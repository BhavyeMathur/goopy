These examples were created to help someone new to Goopy understand how it can be used and applied. Running these examples is very simple:

1. Download the Example Folder
2. Make sure you have goopylib installed

```python
pip install goopylib
```

3. Run the python file inside the example folder

These examples with the code and required textures are included in folders for you to download and try out for 
yourselves!

1. This is a simple, modern, light Login Page that can be used for your application. It demonstrates the usage of 
Checkbox, Entries, and Buttons to take input from the user and was made entirely with just 60 lines of code!. 

This includes giving the user visual feedback if they hover over a button, making sure the user has entered a valid 
input, a functional tab to change from registering to signing up, and more

2. Also provided is a very simple animation of Pac-Man being chased by some ghosts and it was created with just 13 lines 
of code! This really is an example of how simple animations such as these can help make a really good game or project. 

Goopylib also has functionality for other animations such as moving to locations, rotating animations, and a lot more. 
It also contains easy-to-use easing functions like those you would find in a professional animator.

3. A quick hello world example is also part of the examples which demonstrates gliding animations with easing. 

4. The last example is a calendar GUI written to help the user select a date. The calendar is made from RadioButtons and uses more
