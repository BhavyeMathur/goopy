If you would like to contribute to this project, please do so! One of the largest ways is to actually use this library in your own projects and give feedback and report bugs. 

If you would directly like to contribute by helping me develop the code, pick an issue you want from the issues tab, make sure it is open and a valid issue and is not assigned 
to someone else, and work on it however you please. 
It would be helpful if you documented the changes you have made to make it easier for me to merge it with the final file.
If indeed you do decide to help out, 
I will make sure to add your name and how you helped out to the Contributers list. 

Also, it would be great if you could tell your friends about this library and in general increase the fan-base so that we can get even more contributers!
