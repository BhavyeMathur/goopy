## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, go to the issues tab and create a new issue. 
Make sure you provide a good explanation with screenshots if required. 
It shouldn't be too long (1-3 days) before someone replies to your issue 
and fixes the vulnerability.


A vulneribility will be accepted and fixed in most cases, though the 
time to do so may vary depending on how complex the issue is.
