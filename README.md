# Goopy

## Introduction
A simple-yet-powerful 2D graphics framework built on top of Tkinter capable of creating good-looking, modern GUIs, games, and simple animations.

This graphics library is built upon John Zelle's graphics.py package for use with his textbook "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science". Over the past 2 years, I have worked on editing this library to add more featurs to use with making my GUIs and Games. My entire aim while editing was to create a powerful medium to enable me to create good-looking graphics within Python and I have spent a lot of time making sure this is the case. Thus, this is a very intuitive and simple to use package with the potential of growing into one of the best Python Graphics Libraries. 

If you would want to contribute to this library by suggesting features, reporting bugs, or adding changes yourself, please do so. I would love it if you would use this library in your projects and do make sure to tell me about them! Right now, this is very much an alpha stage - there are many bugs, many features that aren't compatible with each other, and a ton of things to do differently, but hopefully this can all be fixed with future releases.
